let's start by loading and examining the heartDisease.csv dataset. 
Then, we'll perform some preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and finally build and evaluate decision tree models to predict heart disease.

Here's the general workflow we'll follow:

1. Load and examine the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
3. Explore the data (visualizations, summary statistics).
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Train decision tree models.
6. Evaluate the models.
